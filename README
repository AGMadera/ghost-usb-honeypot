Ghost is a honeypot for malware that uses USB storage devices
for propagation. It is able to capture such malware without
any further knowledge -- especially, it doesn't need signatures
or the like to accomplish its task.

Detection is achieved by emulating a USB flash drive on
Windows systems and observing the emulated device. The assumption
is that on an infected machine the malware will eventually
copy itself to the removable device.
