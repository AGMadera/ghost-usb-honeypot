=== Building the honeypot ===

If you don't want to use the precompiled packages available from Ghost's website,
you can alternatively compile the code yourself. Please see
http://code.google.com/p/ghost-usb-honeypot/wiki/BuildGuide for instructions.


=== Installing the honeypot ===

Once you have compiled the code, you can install Ghost on your system.
Basically, you just have to run "Setup.exe" with administrative privileges.
For detailed instructions, please refer to
